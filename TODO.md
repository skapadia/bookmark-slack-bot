### End-to-End Tests
- [ ] Set up E2E testing framework for Slack integration
- [ ] Add tests for complete user workflows (bookmark creation, search, help)
- [ ] Add tests for error handling and edge cases

## Features

### Slack Commands

- [ ] Add search filters (date range, specific tags, URL domains)
- [ ] Add "similar bookmarks" suggestions based on tags
- [ ] Add trending/popular bookmarks within teams
- [ ] Implement search result ranking and relevance scoring

### Tag Management
- [ ] Add tag auto-completion in Slack commands
- [ ] Implement tag merging/renaming functionality
- [ ] Add tag usage analytics and cleanup suggestions
- [ ] Allow users to configure AI tag generation preferences
- [ ] Add support for hierarchical/nested tags

## Infrastructure & DevOps

### CI/CD
- [ ] Complete GitHub Actions deployment workflow (`deploy.yml`)
- [ ] Add environment-specific deployment pipelines (dev/staging/prod)
- [ ] Implement database migration strategies for schema changes
- [ ] Add automated rollback capabilities
- [ ] Set up deployment notifications and health checks

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Implement CloudWatch dashboards for Lambda metrics
- [ ] Add custom metrics for bookmark creation rates, tag generation performance
- [ ] Set up alerting for errors and performance degradation
- [ ] Add distributed tracing for request flows between Lambdas
- [ ] Implement log aggregation and search

### Security
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for Slack commands
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
- [ ] Regular security audit of dependencies
- [ ] Implement proper secrets rotation strategy
- [ ] Add request/response encryption for sensitive data

## Performance

### Database
- [ ] Implement database connection pooling optimization
- [ ] Add database query performance monitoring
- [ ] Optimize bookmark search queries with proper indexing
- [ ] Implement database query caching where appropriate
- [ ] Add database backup and disaster recovery procedures

### Lambda Functions
- [ ] Optimize cold start times through provisioned concurrency or other strategies
- [ ] Implement memory usage optimization based on actual usage patterns
- [ ] Add Lambda performance monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Optimize package sizes and dependencies

## Code Quality & Maintenance

### Architecture
- [ ] Refactor shared config to have separate schemas per Lambda (eliminate unused env vars)
- [ ] Review and optimize the fuzzy matching algorithm performance (current O(keywords Ã— tags) complexity)
- [ ] Implement proper error handling hierarchy across all layers
- [ ] Add comprehensive API documentation with OpenAPI specs

### Code Review Items
- [ ] Address Coderabbit.ai suggestions (e.g., replace node-fetch with global fetch when feasible)
- [ ] Regular review of static analysis suggestions

### Code Organization
- [ ] Add comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- [ ] Implement consistent error messages and user feedback
- [ ] Review and standardize logging patterns across packages
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for code quality (formatting, linting, type checking)

### Dependencies
- [ ] Regular dependency updates and security patches
- [ ] Evaluate and potentially replace large dependencies with smaller alternatives
- [ ] Audit bundle sizes and optimize for Lambda deployment

## Documentation

### User Documentation
- [ ] Create comprehensive user guide with examples
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Create video tutorials for setup and usage
- [ ] Document best practices for tag organization

### Developer Documentation
- [ ] Document architecture decisions and trade-offs
- [ ] Create contributor guide with development setup
- [ ] Add API documentation for internal Lambda contracts
- [ ] Document deployment and operational procedures

## Future Enhancements

### Integration
- [ ] Support for other messaging platforms (Microsoft Teams, Discord)
- [ ] Integration with external bookmark services (Pocket, Pinboard)
- [ ] Browser extension for direct bookmark saving
- [ ] API endpoints for third-party integrations

### AI & ML
- [ ] Implement bookmark categorization beyond tagging
- [ ] Add content summarization for long articles
- [ ] Implement personalized bookmark recommendations
- [ ] Explore fine-tuning models for better domain-specific tagging

### Scalability
- [ ] Implement event-driven architecture with SQS/EventBridge

## Contributing

When working on TODO items:
1. Move items to "In Progress" section when starting work
2. Create focused PRs for individual items or related groups
3. Update tests and documentation as part of feature work
4. Remove completed items from this list

## Priority Levels

Items are roughly organized by priority within each section, with testing and infrastructure items generally having higher priority than future enhancements.
